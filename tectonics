- Tectonic plates are chunks of land that act (to some extent) as a single physical entity
- (Locally) Tectonic plates can
    * Join
        - Occurs when two continental plates collide
    * Split
        - Occurs on a single plate when there is a weak point in the crust
    * Collide
        - Divergent
            * Creates a rift zone in which material erupts
                - Adds new material to plates along the boundary
                - Creates volcanoes, grabens, etc.
                - Is lower than the surrounding area
                - Usually fills with water creating a sea
        - Convergent
            * C-C
                - Mountain building occurs
                - The continents are sutured together
                - Metamorphic rocks are created at the boundary
            * C-O
                - The oceanic plate is subducted (due to density)
                - Volcanoes are formed ahead of subduction zone
                - Accretionary wedge forms
            * O-O
                - The denser plate is subducted
                - Volcanic arc forms ahead of subduction zone
                - Deepsea trenches are associated with this collision
        - Transform


? How do plates go from being dense oceanic plates to bouyant continental plates
