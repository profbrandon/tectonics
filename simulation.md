## Ideas

* When two regions separate along a divergent plate boundary:
    1. Collect the empty points
    2. If an empty point is surrounded by crust with thickness less than RUPTURE_THICKNESS, fill with basaltic rock
    3. With the remaining empty points, create a graben by faulting the rock

* When two regions overlap along a convergent plate boundary:
    1. Collect the overlapping points
    2. Create a thrust fault
